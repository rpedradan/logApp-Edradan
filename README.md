# **logApp**
During this pandemic, we usually encounter logbooks in almost every facility around the city. Under Republic Act 11469 or also known as Bayanihan to Heal as One Act, we, as good citizens, are mandated to provide our truthful personal information to logbooks whatnot. However, we cannot deny the fact that some people are hesitant to provide their personal information due to fear of personal information leakage that can be used for illegal activities such as scams and phishing. But nowadays, there are lots of advanced methods uniquely made for this situation in order to somehow avoid these happenings. One of the examples is an application log. This logApp is a sample application that logs the individual's personal information in which only users with an admin account can view the list of people who registered along with their personal information.
